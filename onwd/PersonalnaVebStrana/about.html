            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm Ivana Kostovska, and photography is a hobby that brings me  joy.
                I'm a beginner in photography who finds joy in capturing moments with friends and family.
                My sister, who is particularly dear to me and resembles a model with her beauty, is often my favorite subject.
                Photography has become a passion of mine as I strive to freeze-frame the natural beauty of life.
                Whether it's a wedding, a holiday celebration, or simply a day spent in nature, I aim to capture the essence and
                emotions of each moment. Outside of photography, I enjoy exploring new places, hiking in the mountains, and spending
                quality time with loved ones.
                Thanks for visiting my website!</p>
